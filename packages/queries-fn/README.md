## Time Restriction : hour ; weekday ; month -> ranges;

Objectives: defines restrictives time zone (inclusive or exclusive)
Used with non-positioned queries (only duration)
eg: play instrument: 2h [from now to in one week]
  -> disallow playing at night
could be done with resource management but result will be heavier -> needs a material to "enable" night mode, multiple time (1/day)
